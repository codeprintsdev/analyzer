# codeprints client

This command-line client allows to analyze local/private git repositories,  
generate and upload the data for print on codeprints.

## Why?

A lot of code is not public on Github; especially commerical projects.
Nevertheless there is demand for creating prints from a repository
(e.g. to give them as a present to each team member after reaching a major milestone).

This is why we offer this client that can be used locally without having to
make the code public or install any dependencies.

## Usage

1. Navigate to any Github repository. 
2. Run the following command to generate a `codeprints.json` for the repo:

```
docker run -v `pwd`/repo codeprints/client 
```

This will not parse any sensitive data. It is merely a wrapper around
`git log --date=short-local --pretty=format:%ad`.

3. Upload the JSON file on codeprints.dev to render a print.
