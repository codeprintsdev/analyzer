# codeprints client

A command-line client which analyzes local/private git repositories  
and generates a data file for [codeprints.dev](https://codeprints.dev/).

## Why?

A lot of code is not public on Github; especially commerical projects.
Nevertheless there is demand for creating prints from a repository
(e.g. to give them as a present to each team member after reaching a major milestone).

This is why we offer a client that can be used locally without having to
make any code public or install any dependencies.

## Usage

1. Navigate to any local git repository. 
2. Run the following command to generate a `codeprints.json` for the repo:

```
docker run -v `pwd`:/repo codeprints/client
```

(This will not parse any sensitive data. It is merely a wrapper around
`git log --date=short-local --pretty=format:%ad`.)

3. Upload the JSON file to codeprints.dev to render a print.

## How the Github Contribution Timeline works

The code is based on a great post about the contributions calendar.  
The "algorithm" behind it is [surprisingly sophisticated](https://bd808.com/blog/2013/04/17/hacking-github-contributions-calendar/).
